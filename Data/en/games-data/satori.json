    "The game starts in the Victimland, where a situation to work with is chosen. The player draws a card that directs them to a topic somehow related to events in their life, based on which their story is recalled and voiced.",
    "During the game, you pass through three gates.",
    "First Gate: Awareness.",
    "The player determines what lies behind this event: what beliefs and what blocks in the body it has generated.",
    "Second Gate: Shift.",
    "The player creates a new story about the past event, which helps to look at the situation from a different angle.",
    "Third Gate: Full Acceptance.",
    "The author also calls this stage 'Surrender', that is, the opportunity to fully surrender to what happened and accept it unconditionally, finally freeing oneself from the burden of pain and resentment. At this stage, the player frees themselves from their negative beliefs that gave rise to past stories and surrenders to the power of the Higher Power.",
    "The end of the game is achieving the level of Satori ('Awakening'). Here the player can look at their story from a spiritual point of view, choosing a new happy, joyful, and free reality."
